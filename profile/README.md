# 👾 PixxieAI  
**Building intelligent systems that shape tomorrow.**

PixxieAI is an independent research & development studio focused on creating lightweight, efficient, fully custom AI systems including our flagship model **Pixie**, built from the ground up.

---

## 🚀 What We’re Working On
- **Pixie LLM** – A custom-trained, small to mid scale model built for speed, privacy, and developer freedom  
- **Inference Stack** – High-performance serving using Go based microservices  
- **Pixie Chat** – A friendly, fast, web based AI assistant powered by our own tech  
- **Token + Context Engine** – Infrastructure to handle conversation memory, safety, and reasoning modules  
- **Dev Tools** – APIs, SDKs, and utilities for integrating Pixie into apps and platforms
